            <h3>LINKIN PARK</h3>
                Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame
                with their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-Platinum in several
                  other countries. Their following studio album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart 
                  in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work.
                <br>
                Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora,the band
                explored other genres on their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).The album topped the Billboard charts and had 
                the third-best debut week of any album that year. The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their
                  fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds and beats. Their fifth album, Living 
                  Things (2012), combines musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014),
                  returned to a heavier rock sound. Their seventh album One More Light, a more electronic and pop-oriented record, was released
                    on May 19, 2017.  <br>

                In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. 
                Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.[13] In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest
                artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1.[14] In 2014, the band was declared as the Biggest Rock Band in the World 
                Right Now by Kerrang!. Linkin Park has sold over 75 million albums and singles worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards. <br>

                Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. The three attended Agoura
                High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. After graduating from high school, the three began to take 
                their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band,
                  then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom 
                  studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo tape, entitled Xero. Tensions and frustration within the band grew however after 
                  they failed to land a record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist,
                  to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band. <br>

                After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist Chester Bennington, 
                  who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in March 1999.Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band by
                the name of Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on 
                changing its name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, 
                inciting them to work on new material. In 1999 the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across 
                internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online 'street team'. The band's renaissance culminated with another change 
                in name, this time to Linkin Park, a play on and homage to Santa Monica's Lincoln Park (now called Christine Emerson Reed Park). 
                The band initially wanted to use the name "Lincoln Park", however they changed it to "Linkin" to acquire the internet domain 
                "linkinpark.com". The band still struggled to sign a record deal. Linkin Park turned to Jeff Blue for additional help after facing 
                numerous rejections from several major record labels. After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews,
                  Jeff Blue, now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company in 1999. The band 
                  released its breakthrough album, Hybrid Theory, the following year. <br>

                  Linkin Park has sold more than 70 million records. The group's first studio album Hybrid Theory is one of the best-selling 
                albums in the US (10 million copies shipped) and worldwide (27 million copies sold). Billboard estimates that Linkin Park earned
                US$5 million between May 2011 and May 2012, making them the 40th-highest-paid musical artist. 11 of the band's singles have reached 
                the number one position on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart, the second-most for any artist.
